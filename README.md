# ev3-chess-bot

Chess Bot Client Webapp to interface intepreted camera and Stockfish results with EV3.

Message-passing done via flashing the screen and using an NXT light sensor to recognise the data.

## Setup, Installation and Usage

### (1/2) Chess Engine and Message Passing

Available at: [https://wernjie.github.io/ev3-chess-bot/engine/](https://wernjie.github.io/ev3-chess-bot/engine/)

**Get it up and running:**
1. Run the webapp on a phone in landscape mode. 
2. Initiate full screen mode if possible. 
3. Ensure screen is at ***full brightness*** for best detection performance by the *chess_reader* EV3 later.
4. Enable the camera (tap "Enable Camera" and "Toggle Camera" until your desired one).
5. Mount it with the camera pointing to a white-green chessboard.
6. Ensure the camera sees the entire chessboard in parallel, and is not rotated.
7. Automatic cropping, calibration and normalisation of the camera footage will take over.

While the app detects chess pieces best with uniform lighting, the app can automatically calibrate against shadows spanned completely horizontally, so not to worry about that.

**Understanding the top indicators (left-to-right):**
1. Camera view with auto-crop detection overlay.
2. Auto-cropped output of the camera.
3. Normalised detection. Highlights background colour and piece colours found.
4. Detection interpretation preview:

    | Indicator | Interpretation |
    | --- | --- |
    | ðŸ”´ Red circle | Black chess piece (Black) |
    | ðŸ”µ Blue circle | White chess piece (Beige) |
    | Dark background | Dark chess tile (Green) |
    | Light background | Light chess tile (White) | 
    | Gray background | Chess tile (but detected mix of Green and White) |
    | Orange background | No tile detected |
    | Orange background w/ H | Human hand covers tile completely |
    | Orange outline | Current interpretation is uncertain |

**Important caveats as of writing:**
- Chrome on Android required for toggling flash.
- On iPhone, Safari might be necessary for fullscreen-like functionality using the Hide Toolbar option.

### (2/2) EV3 controller network

Use the legacy [EV3 Lab software](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/retiredproducts/mindstorms-ev3-lab/software) to open the EV3-G code and install it on three separate EV3 bots.

All movements are on repeated LEGO Technic 1x4 geared racks (3743) with 36 tooth double bevel gears (32498).

The default names for the three 'robots' are listed below and should be self-explanatory.

#### chess_x_axis

Run program `x-axis` and wait for calibration confirmation beep. Should rest slightly before column A.

**Details:**

- Movement using *Large Motor B*.
    - Runs in reverse direction (negative power drives movement from column A to column H), offset -80Â° rotation away from chessboard column A (outside of the board).
- Pickup mechanism on *Large Motor A*.
    - range of motion approx slightly under 90Â°. Positive rotation to move mechanism down.
- Claw mechanism on *Medium Motor D*.
    - Jammable to close and open positions at 100% power in under 0.2 seconds. Positive rotation for closing.

Range of motion available from ***80Â° motor rotation before column A*** (jammed completely at full power) to ***column H***.

#### chess_y_axis

Run program `y-axis` and wait for calibration confirmation beep. Should rest slightly past "row 9", ready to play as black.

**Details:**

- Movement *Medium Motor C* for left side (next to chessboard column A; clockwise goes from rows 8-1)
- Movement *Medium Motor B* for right side (next to chessboard column H; anticlockwise goes from rows 8-1).

Range of motion available from ***row 1*** to ***95Â° motor rotation past "row 9"*** (i.e. one imaginary row out of chess board, jammed completely).

---
#### chess_reader

Run program `phone-reader` and ensure successful connection to the two other EV3s. Ensure NXT light sensor is connected at port 3. Press Center button for first-time black level calibration. Make sure screen displays "READY".

**Details:**

- *NXT Light Sensor* at port 3. Mount in less than one piece distance above the screen. Ensure **screen is at full brightness**.

This asynchronously reads screen flashes from phone and interprets as movement.

**Shortcuts:**

- Press Center button to calibrate black levels at any time.
- Press Left button to forcibly terminate all pending requests and request movement to top left (1,0) position, then terminate `phone-reader`. Useful in event of corrupted transmission. If this does not work, you'll need to manually terminate all robot programs.
- Press Right button to send an arbitrary request to perform move b7g3 or g7b3 to test movement accuracy. Warning: Only initiate when idle or may cause transmission corruption.
